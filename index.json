However, we currently do not understand the mechanism by which copper brought into cells as ES–Cu(II) is released and delivered to cuproenzymes present in different subcellular compartments. Here, we have utilized a combination of genetic, biochemical, and cell-biological approaches to demonstrate that intracellular release of copper from ES occurs inside and outside of mitochondria. The mitochondrial matrix reductase, FDX1, catalyzes the reduction of ES–Cu(II) to Cu(I), releasing it into mitochondria where it is bioavailable for the metalation of mitochondrial cuproenzyme— cytochrome c oxidase. Consistently, ES fails to rescue cytochrome c oxidase abundance and activity in copper-deficient cells lacking FDX1. In the absence of FDX1, the ES-dependent increase in cellular copper is attenuated but not abolished. Thus, ES-mediated copper delivery to nonmitochondrial cuproproteins continues even in the absence of FDX1, suggesting alternate mechanism(s) of copper release. Importantly, we demonstrate that this mechanism of copper transport by ES is distinct from other clinically used copper-transporting drugs. Our study uncovers a unique mode of intracellular copper delivery by ES and may further aid in repurposing this anticancer drug for copper deficiency disorders.","tags":[],"title":"FDX1-dependent and Independent Mechanisms of Elesclomol-mediated Intracellular Copper Delivery","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Research Summary This project is an analysis of the Rotten Tomatoes Movies dataset, sourced from Kaggle.

However, the relationship between cellular redox status and Cu homeostasis and how such an interplay is coordinated within cellular compartments has not yet been well established. Using combined approaches of organelle-specific redox sensor Grx1-roGFP2 and non-targeted proteomics, we investigate the real-time Cu-dependent antioxidant defenses of mitochondria and cytosol in live HEK293 cells. The Cu-dependent real-time imaging experiments show that CuCl2 treatment results in increased oxidative stress in both cytosol and mitochondria. In contrast, subsequent excess Cu removal by bathocuproine sulfonate, a Cu chelating reagent, lowers oxidative stress in mitochondria but causes even higher oxidative stress in the cytosol. The proteomic data reveal that several mitochondrial proteins, but not cytosolic ones, undergo significant abundance change under Cu treatments. The proteomic analysis also shows that proteins with significant changes are related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glutathione synthesis. The differences in redox behaviors and protein profiles in different cellular compartments reveal distinct mitochondrial and cytosolic response mechanisms upon Cu-induced oxidative stress. These findings provide insights into how redox and Cu homeostasis interplay by modulating specific protein expressions at the subcellular levels, shedding light on understanding the effects of Cu-induced redox misregulation on the diseases.","tags":[],"title":"Subcellular redox responses reveal different Cu-dependent antioxidant defenses between mitochondria and cytosol","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Research Summary This project observed the YouTube’s Videos category, counts, likes and comments based per country and its relation to each other.

Mitochondria appear to have more efficient restoration of Cu-dependent GSH/GSSG ratio than the cytosol. The corresponding proteomics data show that several mitochondrial proteins involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and GSH synthesis rapidly undergo significant abundance changes after prolonged Cu treatments. In contrast, cytosolic proteins involved in GSH synthesis undergo substantial changes after Cu reduction. In other words, mitochondria and cytosol have different antioxidant defense mechanisms upon Cu-dependent oxidative stress despite both modulating GSH/GSSG system.
